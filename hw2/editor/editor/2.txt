The cat went here and there
And the moon spun round like a top
But the nearest kin of the star
The creeping cat looked up
Black Minnaloushe stared at the moon
For wander and wail as he would
The pure cold light in the sky
Troubled his animal blood
Minnaloushe runs in the grass
Lifting his delicate feet
